= 2017 Review

Before going to discuss plans for 2018 let’s recall what was done by ETCDEV team during year 2017.

The main accomplishment was that the team was established, that was a very challenging task, with very limited funding,
under constant pressure from all sides and toxic environment, but by end of the year we grew up to 8 full time
members in the ETCDEV team. The team got established development processes, working full time on core ETC projects,
and will continue to grow.

Quick outline of the year:

- _Hardfork at block 3M_ to pause the Difficulty Bomb. While this was done by Igor Artamonov alone, it was during the
    time of first steps to form a team and he was forming the team and looking for and interviewing first
    engineers at very same moment. Beginning of February is official time when the development was started with
    first full time developers
- ETCDEV made huge refactoring, cleanup and introduced a lot of improvements to Geth codebase, with _more than 1100
    commits_ for past year and https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases[8 releases]. Now it’s a
    flexibility node, supports different types of networks and custom/private blockchains. If you look at the Geth
    code, you’ll see that about 30% of current codebase is
    written by ETCDEV developers. That’s a huge change, it’s a new software now. To our surprise some new blockchains
    started to base
    their work on top of Classic Geth now, instead of ETH Geth. That probably means ETCDEV in a right path.
- _Moved to new monetary policy_. That was a big task, included not only modifications to Geth and Parity
    codebases. Geth code was just a tip of the iceberg, much more work were outside of core code, such as
    https://github.com/ethereumproject/ecip1017test[testing under different conditions], and making sure that all
    external software will continue to work under new monetary supply
- Built a https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-wallet[desktop wallet] from scratch, with support of light/remote nodes, hardware wallets, and many other things.
    Finally ETC got own wallet and is not dependent on 3rd party ones.
- https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-cli[Command line tools to operate blockchain from shell scripts], send
    and receive coins, sign transactions and many
    more in lightweight and secure way, which could be integrated into or used together with other server side software
- Totally https://github.com/ethereumproject/sputnikvm[new EVM for Ethereum projects]. Standalone, embeddable, fast
    and flexible. It got integrated into Geth as
    optional EVM and is being tested now. Together with other libraries, such as Emerald Vault, it gives a lot of
    opportunities to build secure blockchain enabled software for with support of IoT and low powered hardware
- In addition to IoT we got Javascript libraries to help building 3rd party Dapps on top of Ethereum, and Emerald
    Wallet is just a first example of such dapps
- By numbers it’s https://github.com/ethereumproject[16 new projects] (in Github terms) and _more than 5000 total
    commits_ for year 2017. Or almost 20 commits per working day, counting ETCDEV work alone.

That was a productive year, a lot of stuff was done and more to be done for year 2018

= Plans for 2018

First of all, we’ll continue our team growth, hire more engineers and managers, solidify our processes and we'll
continue our work.

One of the main focuses will be _scale through sidechains_. That’s big and very challenging task, it’s requires a lot
of research and experiments. Right now we’re setting up some pilot projects with third party companies, and we’re
very open for collaboration on this field.

Another topic is _bringing Ethereum Classic to IoT_. We already have significant progress in this direction, you
already can run whole stack on embeddable hardware, we have separate modules, including lightweight components such
as Emerald Vault and Emerald CLI, and Sputnik VM, which will allow to build different types of applications. We’re
going to improve it, find new ways of using it for practical applications and make experiments with partners.

Of course we’re going to continue our work on _Emerald Platform_, going to release Emerald Desktop Wallet, make Mobile
Wallet and few other Dapps. As well as help other companies to use Emerald Platform in their services.

A more detailed roadmap will be published soon on the website, stay tuned.
