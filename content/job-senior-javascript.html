                <h2>What we're doing</h2>
                <p>
                    ETCDEV team started a new project called <strong>Emerald Project</strong>, which is designed to be a base platform
                    to build apps on top of Ethereum Classic. It can be a mobile app, desktop app, or browser-based
                    apps and sites. It consists of several layers, to connect to a RPC, to sign transactions,
                    and to provide a user UI. Last part is written in Javascript, and can be embedded into other apps
                    and websites. As a main product, we build Emerald Wallet, which is an official ETC wallet and a
                    reference application build on top of Emerald Platform
                </p>
