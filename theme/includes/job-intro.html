    <h2>About our team</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://ethereumclassic.github.io/">Ethereum Classic</a> is an independent community driven
        blockchain continued after EF (a foundation originally started Ethereum blockchain) moved to a
        separate fork by introducing censoring transactions into their blockchain. Ethereum Classic
        community opposed that fork and kept original chain, because it believes in Blockchain
        Immutability and Code Is Law principles of blockchain.
