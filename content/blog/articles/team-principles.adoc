## Pragmatic approach

Our main focus is on making Ethereum Classic a stable _and_ usable technology. Opposite to _move fast and break things_.
That also means making right architecture design, with taking into account how our projects are going to be used by 3rd
party developers, and how it is going to be maintained in next decade.

It’s important to mention here that our team lead by seasoned developers, each with more than 10 years of experience
in software engineering. We understand how to build a system supposed to work for years, we saw them a lot and we
know common pitfalls.

## Technology, not a product
We are working on Ethereum Classic as a technology, on protocol and tools for developers. Making a product from it is
not our goal. It means that instead of providing an ultimate node implementation, or an ultimate wallet for ETC, we
rather provide a set of components for different implementations, different modules and tools for 3rd party developers.

## Apache 2 license
We don’t want to limit usage of ETC technology, any 3rd party developer or business should be able to include part of
our technologies into their applications without any restriction. To allow that we have been developing all new
projects under most commercial friendly license _Apache 2_.

The only exception at the moment is _Geth Classic_, which came from EF and it was already licensed under _GPL/LGPL_.
Unfortunately we can’t do anything with that now, and we’ll continue Geth development under same license. This is our
main client, a reference implementation, and we’ll continue to maintain it and add new features as well.

But to improve that situation with Geth license, we have a strategy to provide replacements for critical parts as a
separate modules, which can be useful for 3rd party developers. These modules going to be developed from scratch, and
licensed under Apache 2 as well. This will include new EVM, State storage and network protocol library.

## Non Profit
That’s most controversial moment, but we’re aren’t doing consulting, or development for 3rd party services. That’s
because we think at current state it’s really important to focus on protocol and technology itself.

It also includes that we don’t implement features in return to donations or investments. And every major decision
related to core development comes through Ethereum Classic community discussion and ECIP process.

## Working close with the community
We are a standalone team, but our intention is to help Ethereum Classic. We’re following Open Source principles for
development and fully dedicated to Ethereum Classic community. There’re many other members in Ethereum Classic community
who works on same projects with us, participate in discussion, send Pull Requests and ECIPs, and provide other help.
We’re working together on our common goal.

Igor Artamonov (@splix), team CTO, has been working all his time on Ethereum Classic since the first day. He has been
constantly looking for passionate developers, and has been building a team of like-minded people to help
Ethereum Classic development.

More to that, our advisors are the people who joined Ethereum Classic in first few days after HF happened. That’s the
people who truly passionate about Ethereum Classic, and they help us with different aspects of our work.
