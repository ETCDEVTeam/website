Last Dev Update was at end of May, but it doesn't mean we stopped the work. Quite opposite, we were too busy on Geth,
on Emerald project and on SputnikVM. Making a Dev Update requires time, at least one hour per week taken from
development time, and it's not the thing we can afford right now. We understand that informing our users about
the progress is important job, so we're going to continue publishing such reports, just once a month or two instead of weekly updates.
Until we'll become big enough to have a dedicated person for this kind of communication.

Short list of ETCDEV Team progress for past 2 months:

 * two releases of Geth - https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases
 * two Alpha and the Beta release of Emerald Wallet - https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-wallet/releases
 * working implementation of SputnikVM, fully tested against whole history of ETC blockchain. Currently published
   as an crate library - https://crates.io/crates/sputnikvm
 * set of other libraries and mini projects developed
   ** Janus, which helps us to distribute every successful build to public server - https://github.com/ethereumproject/janus
   ** Set of reusable Rust libs to operate common ETC data structures - https://github.com/ethereumproject/etcommon-rs
 * started to work on ECIPs for
   ** on-chain voting for protocol upgrades (https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/62[ECIP-1022], https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/64[ECIP-1023], https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/65[ECIP-1024])
   ** security and zkSNARK (https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/66[ECIP-1025], https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/67[ECIP-1026])
   ** scalability through sidechains (https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/69[ECIP-1027, ECIP-1028])
 * started to deploy all artifacts to http://builds.etcdevteam.com


Emerald Wallet is our new project, and it just reached first Beta version. We expect more beta releases before
Release Candidate of the wallet. We still don't have any JS developer in our team who will work full time on the
project, and a lot of the work was done by community volunteers. Huge thanks to https://github.com/elaineo[@elaineo]
and https://github.com/gagarin55[@gagarin55].

We expect that a JS developer will join our team this week, on a full time basis, but we still looking for more
developers who would be interested to join (see link:/job-senior-javascript.html[job info]). Want to notice that
all of our current developers started as community volunteers and we're happy to have them in our team.
