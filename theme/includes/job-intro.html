    <h2>About our team</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://ethereumclassic.github.io/">Ethereum Classic</a> is an independent community driven
        blockchain continued after EF (a foundation originally started Ethereum blockchain) moved to a
        separate fork by introducing censoring transactions into their blockchain. Ethereum Classic
        community opposed that fork and kept original chain because it believes in Blockchain
        Immutability.
    </p>

    <p>
        ETCDEV was formed as an independent team working on core and protocol level projects of Ethereum Classic blockchain.
        ETCDEV team developers are passionate developer which work full time on these projects.
