=== The team

*Stewart (@sjm)* has left us to join the hoards of ICO overachievers, tempting fate
with a brilliant scheme to unify and simplify Dapp programming with a Nix-based
package manager and graph-based language using the _Fractalide_ system.

While we were sorry to see Stewart leave, we are very glad to welcome Javascript
developer *Yury (@gagarin55)*. Yury has a broad and diverse background in blockchain
technology and applications, and has been a longtime steady and vital force in the ETC community. He's wasted no time in providing a myriad of firm, yet gentle, refactorings, fixes, and new features for Emerald Wallet.

And as always, we are extremely grateful to *the many volunteers and members of our community* for
so many creative, thoughtful, and ongoing contributions. I'm going to embarass
myself by listing too few deserving names...
@elaineou, @pyskell, @dontpanicburns, @etherninja, @dulanov, @dexaran, @seberino,
and the list goes on... Again, thank _you all_.


=== The projects

==== Geth

- Implemented https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/blob/master/ECIPs/ECIP-1017.md[ECIP-1017] monetary policy protocol changes in the *4.0.0 release*, as well as a few other features and improvements, including establishing a machine-logging system (as yet unreleased) for use with log parsers/+analysis, e.g. Filebeat/Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana. The latest stable releases can always be found on the [Github Release page](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases), and change details can be found in https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[the changelog]. If you use geth, please upgrade!

==== SputnikVM

- Created https://github.com/ethereumproject/sputnikvm-dev/releases[SputnikVM-Dev], an interactive environment using https://github.com/ethereumproject/sputnikvm[SputnikVM] and https://github.com/ethereumproject/etcommon-rs[etcommon] to enable *development and testing on SputnikVM via RPC*. Just look at all those https://github.com/ethereumproject/sputnikvm-dev[supported methods]!
- For bonus points, @sorpaas also built a minimalist (but fully functioning!) client with Sputnik and etcommon called https://github.com/sorpaas/etclient[etclient].


==== Emerald Wallet

- A *second beta release* https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-wallet/releases[v0.5.0-beta2] of Emerald Wallet will be available this week, including features, improvements, and fixes relating to key import/export, hardware support, and UI improvements.
- Extracted reusable Javascript components to a new package https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-js[emerald-js].


==== Emerald Vault + CLI

- Refactored Emerald Vault into *two packages*: https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-rs[Emerald Vault] now contains the Emerald business and security logic, and https://github.com/ethereumproject/emerald-cli[Emerald CLI] now contains the user-facing CLI application connected with Vault. This separation of concerns should pave the way for smoother future-feature implementations and core and Dapp developer experiences.


=== ECIPs

Several new proposals have been added, including

- designs for a *stealth account schema*
- a fallback plan for *Difficulty Bomb Diffusion*
- a recursive length prefix *(RLP) media type* for streamlining HTTP responses
- changes relating to the *GHOST protocol* for using uncles in total difficulty calculation
- options for increasing address and transaction *readability*
- an outline for beginning discussions around *sidechains*

As usual, all proposals associated discussions can be found in the https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pulls[ECIPs Github repository].
