                    At this moment ETCDEV team has enough funding to continue development of core ETC projects. 
                    But if you want to support ETCDEV development, you can make a small donation to address
                    below. We don't have any plans on such donations at this moment, but we think we're going to
                    spend them on development related activities, such as running additional servers, running
                    tech events, do a team building on some paradise island, and so on.

                <p>ETC community historically had an address for general donations, which are kept
                    until ETC will come to a proper community approved way to spend them on development and
                    related activities. Following address is controlled and spent by ETC community members,
