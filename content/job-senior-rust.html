                <h2>What we're doing</h2>
                <p>
                    ETCDEV team started a new project called <strong>Sputnik VM</strong>, which is a new EVM for Ethereum and Ethereum
                    Classic. This project is developed as a standalone component, which can be embedded into other
                    apps, or as an app for development needs and debugging of Ethereum contracts. This project has
                    no ties to any of existing clients, such as Geth or Parity, and can be use absolutely
                    independently. This is a large project, requires deep knowledge of Computer Science, understanding
                    of data structures, optimization techniques and building safe architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another new project is <strong>Emerald Project</strong>, which is an SDK for dapp developers. It also has a Rust
                    based backend for connectivity, transactions signatures, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to that, we maintain support of Ethereum Classic in <strong>Ethcore Parity</strong> client.
