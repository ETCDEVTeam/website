                    ETCDEV Team is a non-profit organization supported by donations. All of the members are truly
                    passionate about ethereum and want to make it best technology platform. Most of this people has
                    more that 10 years of experience in different areas of software engineering, and understand
                    how to build a technology that can be a strong foundation for other services.

                <p>
                    ETCDEV Team is not providing consulting services and doesn't have any source of income, just
                    focusing on build Ethereum Classic technologies on a full time basis. Because that's the most
                    critical thing at the moment.
