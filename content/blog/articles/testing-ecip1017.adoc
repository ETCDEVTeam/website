title: Testing ECIP-1017 New Monetary Policy

This December Ethereum Classic will switch to a new monetary policy, which comes under ECIP-1017. It was actively
discussed this past winter, and was accepted by the community. We at ETCDEV had implemented it by May, for both
Parity and Geth, and have been testing extensively after that. In early September it was enabled on Mainnet with
https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/releases[Geth 4.x.x] (and also enabled on Morden testnet at block 2M).

In addition to testing our implementation via unit tests and manual testing, we decided that we need to provide a
public system to verify full integration with a network. These tools and environments would then be useful for
hobbyists experimenting with ETC, for Dapp developers to test compatibility with upcoming fork, and as a composable,
reusable system to explore and test network integration in the future.

A private chain fits these needs well, since it can be easily configured to exactly simulate the anticipated
“real-world” chain configuration rollout. With that in mind, our next challenge would be to establish an easy-to-use
system to deploy and then verify the behavior of the network.

## Test network

We designed a simple network, with 8 nodes and 2 miners, using a mix of Parity and Geth clients. To more realistically
replicate the real network, we added simulation of network issues and latency. This allowed us to demonstrate fair
block and uncle distribution. The configuration would also allow CPU mining, enabling it to be run on basic hardware.

You can run the following topology in few clicks with https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/[Google Cloud Containers],
or in any https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster.

We’ve prepared set of command line tools to setup the network, check status and verify resulting blockchain and miners
earnings. While ECIP-1017 specified a new era every 5,000,000 (5 million) blocks, our default configuration would be
500 blocks, so in 2-3 hours (instead of 2-3 years!) of running that private chain, the network will switch to an era
covered by ECIP-1017 with 20% reduced monetary supply, and we’ll be able to verify that block reward and miner total
earning matches specification.

## How it works

First of all, you’ll need to create a new Container Engine cluster on https://cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud]. If you
don’t have Google Cloud account you’ll have to register one, and will need to enable the Google Compute API. There
is also an option to run the network on a custom Kubernetes cluster, but that’s out of the scope of default scripts;
you’ll have to modify them for a non-Google project.

One you’ve set up your Compute Cluster and finished setup, you can deploy the network with `bin/deploy.sh`:

## Checking network status

Then, check the status with `bin/status.py`:

As you can see here, the blockchain is working as expected, we’re in the second era already, and there is no fork. Woohoo!

In fact, finding a fork sometime is normal, because we’re emulating the nature of the network. Mining nodes can start
following alternate forks, competing for total difficulty and longest chain. Like this:

You might want to kill one of the miners, so it will restart with following another branch. In this way, you can
actually play with the network, restart parts of it, or even setup your own network topology if you’re familiar
with Kubernetes.

## Verify state

What we want to see and demonstrate is that both Geth and Parity are able to follow the same chain after the expected
monetary policy reward reduction. We also want to verify that all participants of our ECIP-1017 enabled blockchain
determine the correct state and amounts of earned rewards. To that end, we made `verify.py` script, which downloads
the whole blockchain in question to a local computer (be patient, it can take some time ;) and finally verify each
block for correctness.

In addition to testing compatibility of Geth, Parity and other clients, you can use it to emulate an Ethereum
application under different conditions, so feel free to modify this sample network for your needs
